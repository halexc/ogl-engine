# ogl-engine
This is my first attempt at fully writing a 3D engine in OpenGL. This engine is supposed to be capable of loading and handling 3D mesh models, simulate physics, and using input.


# Important Notice!
Before trying to compile, make sure to download all the necessary libraries which are referenced through the include files.
